# Twitter Sentiment Analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic


## Summary:


The COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges around public health, remote learning and work. The aim of this project is to analyse public sentiments and uncover meaningful themes of concern around the pandemic posted by Twitter users. This project will analyse frequency of keywords and symptoms, sentiments around keywords ‘coronavirus’, ‘online learning’ and ‘work from home’ and topic modelling around major themes and topics. Kafka will be used to count the frequency of words and Python will be used for sentiment analysis and topic modelling. Tweepy library on Python will be used for sentiment analysis and genism library will be used to apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modelling. All codes would be run on the GCP for fast and efficient results.
